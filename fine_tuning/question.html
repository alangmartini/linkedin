Professional Summary

With an initial background in Culinary Arts, I honed leadership and management skills under pressure in international settings and Michelin-starred restaurants. My passion for technology and programming, sparked during my teenage years through developing hacks and bots for games, led me to pursue a career as a developer. Currently, I am focused on the area of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and DevOps, particularly in automation and monitoring, creating deployment pipelines, application redundancy, and monitoring application health and golden signals.
